🧬 Project Idea: “MediMorph AI” – Medical Instructions Rewritten for Grandparents

🩺 Problem:
Older adults (especially in rural or Tier-2 areas) struggle to:

Understand complex medical terms on prescriptions or health portals

Follow care instructions written in technical or English-heavy language

💡 Solution:
MediMorph AI takes a medical instruction or diagnosis (in English or medical jargon) and rewrites it in ultra-simple, regional-language format, optionally with a text-to-speech voice output.
